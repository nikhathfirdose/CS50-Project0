        "Hi! I am Nikhath Firdose pursuing Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation. I developed an interest in 
        Web programming quite recently and am trying to learn about the new technologies in this domain and build a career in it. </p>
        <span class="questions"> Who am i as an Individual?</span>
        <p>I am an optimistic, ambitious, and goal-oriented person. I do not let failure put me down and belive in trying until I succeed, and I solely believe a person can reach his goal only with complete determination and consistency. I wake up daily trying to be a better person as I was yesterday and work hard to get things done without an excuse  </p>
          <span class="questions"> My Interests? </span> 
          <p> My Hobbies include Travelling, Gardening, Painting, and Public Speaking. my Travelling images can be viewed <a href="interests.html"> Here!</a>
        I have visited most places in the southern part of India and planning on traveling to many different countries in the coming years. Travelling allows a person to develop a different perspective on life.
        Painting and Gardening help me relax, and Public speaking helps me get rid of self-doubt and constant overthinking of other's judgment.</p>
        <p> So well that is me as a person, I hope that was an interesting read for you :) </p>
